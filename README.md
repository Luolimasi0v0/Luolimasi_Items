# Luolimasi_Items

A Balatro mod, currently includes:
- 15 brand-new Joker cards

## Important Notes
- **Requires SMODS**: https://github.com/Steamodded/smods — please install before use.
- Due to my poor drawing skills and limited experience with AI-generated art, some icons may look rather silly. You are welcome to modify them if interested. (If anyone is willing to contribute better artwork, that would be even more appreciated — though I can't offer any monetary compensation, sorry QWQ.)
- The in-game English text is machine-translated from Chinese and may contain errors or awkward phrasing.
- **This README is also machine-translated.** While I've tried to ensure clarity, some sentences may sound unnatural or unclear. For the most accurate information, please refer to the [Chinese version](README_zh.md).
- Additionally, since this is my first time releasing a mod like this, the original Chinese descriptions might also be unpolished or redundant. Apologies in advance.
- If you have any issues or suggestions, feel free to bring them up.
